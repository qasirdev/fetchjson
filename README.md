### Faker library

npm install faker@5.5.3
npm install @types/faker@5.5.9

A community fork of Faker was made to save the project and they are actively working on some fixes and a fresh v6 release:

https://github.com/faker-js/faker

If you wish to use this library instead, you can install it by running:

npm install @faker-js/faker

You'll then need to update your imports:

import { faker } from "@faker-js/faker";

As of their v6 release, TS support is now native and does not require installing the @types declarations.

### Google Maps Key

If you do not have a credit card tied to your Google account, or do not want to add one, then please use this pre-generated API key instead:

AIzaSyBNLrJhOMz6idD05pzfn5lhA-TAw-mAZCU

You can skip the entire next video. After the next video, your index.html file should look like this:

<html>
  <body>
    <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyBNLrJhOMz6idD05pzfn5lhA-TAw-mAZCU"></script>
    <script src="./src/index.ts"></script>
  </body>
</html>

### types/googlemaps

npm install @types/google.maps

Also, you will still see a TS error in your code editor:

Cannot find name 'google'.ts(2304)

As the very first line in the index.ts file, you will need to add a triple slash directive:

/// <reference types="@types/google.maps" />
You can read about this in the official docs here:
